LEGAL NOTICE INFORMATION
------------------------

All the files in this distribution are copyright to the terms below.

== lib/perpetual.ex
== lib/perpetual/server.ex
== test/perpetual_test.exs

These files are derivative works based on the following files from Elixir's source code:

- lib/elixir/lib/agent.ex
- lib/elixir/lib/agent/server.ex
- lib/elixir/test/elixir/agent_test.exs

The original source is available here: https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/tree/v1.11.1/lib/elixir/lib

Notable changes:

- Renamed `Agent` to `Perpetual` (new namespace, not to conflict with Agent)
- Extended the original implementation beyond Agent's original functionality
  (for example, specifying a "next" function instead of just an initial
  function, and using GenServer timeouts to iterate automatically)
- Extended the original tests to fit this new implementation's behavior
- Modified the documentation slightly to fit this new implementation's API,
  although most of the documentation is the same as the original documentation
  wherever the behavior stayed the same.
